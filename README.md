# Machine Learning Model Deployment

Hello everyone, this is a machine learning model deployment project where we have presented the Iris classification model in an elegant basic minimal ui using flask web framework and deployed it in Azure cloud using Azure app service. 
    We initially made the notebook file, with model code and some data preperations (preprocessing). Then we have took some chunks of code and put the necessary in web project. Then we have deployed it into Azure app service. 
    We initially made this project as a requirement for an internship at Indian Servers. We are now making it open to contribution.
